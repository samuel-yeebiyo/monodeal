# Monodeal Game

This is a clone of the Monopoly Deal game.

You can clone this repo onto your local machine and try it out for yourself. This repo includes both the react frontend and the node server. Feel free to change things up and maybe even suggest changes.

To run this on your local machine, you can use all the default npm scripts

1. Clone repo
2. Run the server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
3. Run the react app
```bash
cd monodeal
npm start
```

Since this is a multiplayer game, you can open another tab and go to localhost:3000 to checkout what the game looks like.

Enjoy!
